React Quiz Game
=====================

Using Dan Abramov boilerplate "https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate"

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Linting

This boilerplate project includes React-friendly ESLint configuration.

```
npm run lint
```

### Using `0.0.0.0` as Host

You may want to change the host in `server.js` and `webpack.config.js` from `localhost` to `0.0.0.0` to allow access from same WiFi network. This is not enabled by default because it is reported to cause problems on Windows. This may also be useful if you're using a VM.
